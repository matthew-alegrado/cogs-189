# COGS 189 Project Repository

Our project aims to classify EEG signals from the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset to distinguish between real and imagined motor movements. This research has potential applications in controlling prosthetic limbs, where users with motor impairments could use motor imagery-based BCIs to generate movement commands, enabling hands-free control of robotic prosthetics through brain activity alone.
